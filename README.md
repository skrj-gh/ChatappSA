Hi I am Shubham Kumar Jha and I am along with Aryan Patel. We have developed this Chatapp.

To Start the app---
1. In the root folder open the terminal and type "cd client"
2. Then type "yarn dev"
3. This will create application on localhost:3000

3. In the root folder open the terminal and type "cd server"
4. Then type "yarn start"

5. In the root folder open the terminal and type "cd server"
6. Then type "npx prisma studio"


This is enough to launch the application
